I would like to thanks Nikita Veshchikov, my supervisor, for the helpful advices he gave me throughout the long journey that is writing a thesis, but also for his many reviews which made my work what it is now.

I would also like to thanks Olivier Markowitch, my promoter and teacher, for letting me write on a topic of my choosing.

Finally, I want to give a very special thanks to Pabla Marmolejo, who, from the southernmost country on Earth, managed to give me the most valuable help in the form of love and hours of proofreading.
